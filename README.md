# SearchIsOver

### App Description:
The SearchIsOver app displays a list of all ice cream flavors by default. The app has some built-in filters which will display only the ice cream flavors based on the filter(s) selected.

The "None of the Above" filter will display the ice cream flavors that do not contain any of the available filters.

Built in SwiftUI.
